What:
- list includes default credentials from various manufacturers, for example for mssql, vnc and so on
- also examples for passwords, in practice those are also being used
- the sources are installation guides and other
- useful for network bruteforcing
- not meant as a complete bruteforcing list, hopefully it is a usefull supplement

Why:
- some manufactures use default credentials for their products
- that might be poorly handled by the users
- setting networks at risk

What to do:
- manufacturers: do not use default passwords, instead force users to use strong credentials and document them
- users: check if it is possible to change the credentials, otherwise mitigate the risk, for example by network seperation or by using proper firewall rules - yes, you can actualy use local firewalls too
